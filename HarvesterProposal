Title: Flavortown Proposal Series 

Item: Harvester a.k.a. The FlavorSavior a.k.a Danny Wegmans

Purpose: This application is built strictly for scheduling harvest jobs based on what I've 
called a Harvest Strategy, which I'll refer to as just Harvest in this proposal. The details are available in the Harvest Strategy section below. Beyond the scope of strictly scheduling harvest jobs we wish to bring the ability to do in depth monitoring to our harvest process.

Business Details: Allow for logging and stats tracking to provide insights into the harvest process from start to finish.  Partner request building, wire time, response parsing are all details which I hope to capture.

Technical Details: The current strategy for harvests in OG is build an array of users which 
has been randomized based on the Ruby #shuffle method.  That number is then divided
